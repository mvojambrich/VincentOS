# Code of Conduct for VincentOS

## Our Commitment

VincentOS is a **governance-first operating architecture for cognition**. As such, the community around it must reflect the same values the architecture enforces: responsibility, accountability, respect, and trust.

We are committed to providing a harassment-free, professional, and inclusive environment for everyone who participates in the VincentOS project—regardless of background, experience level, affiliation, or viewpoint.

---

## Expected Behavior

All participants in the VincentOS community are expected to:

- Communicate with professionalism, clarity, and respect
- Engage in good-faith technical and architectural discussion
- Respect differing perspectives and areas of expertise
- Accept constructive feedback without hostility
- Prioritize safety, governance, and integrity over ego or recognition
- Assume positive intent, especially in complex or high-stakes discussions

Disagreement is natural and welcome. Disrespect is not.

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not tolerated:

- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks of any kind
- Dismissive, demeaning, or belittling language
- Aggressive escalation, intimidation, or coercion
- Repeated bad-faith arguments or deliberate misrepresentation
- Attempts to bypass governance processes through social pressure
- Promotion of unbounded autonomy, unsafe systems, or deceptive practices

This applies across all project spaces, including issues, pull requests, discussions, documentation, and external forums where VincentOS is represented.

---

## Governance-Focused Collaboration

Because VincentOS addresses safety-critical and trust-sensitive domains:

- Architectural rigor takes precedence over speed
- Safety concerns override performance or novelty arguments
- Human authority and accountability are non-negotiable

Participants are expected to engage with these principles seriously and responsibly.

---

## Reporting & Enforcement

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:

- Report it privately to the project maintainer or designated contact
- Provide as much context as possible (links, screenshots, descriptions)

All reports will be reviewed confidentially and handled in good faith.

The project maintainer may take any action deemed appropriate, including:

- Informal warnings
- Content removal
- Temporary or permanent bans from participation

The goal of enforcement is **community safety and project integrity**, not punishment.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- All VincentOS repositories
- All contribution channels (issues, pull requests (PRs), discussions)
- Project-related communications in public forums where VincentOS is discussed

---

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by established open-source community standards (including the Contributor Covenant), adapted to reflect the governance-first and safety-oriented nature of VincentOS.

---

## Final Note

VincentOS is built on the belief that **intelligence without governance does not scale**.

The same is true for communities.

If you participate here, you are expected to help uphold a culture worthy of the responsibility this project carries.
