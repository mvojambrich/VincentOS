# Contributing to VincentOS

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **VincentOS**.

VincentOS is a **governance-first operating architecture for cognition**. Contributions are welcome, but they are evaluated through a different lens than typical software projects. This document explains how to engage productively, safely, and constructively.

---

## Guiding Principle

> **Architectural integrity over speed.**

VincentOS prioritizes correctness, coherence, and long-term trustworthiness over rapid feature growth. Contributions that increase complexity without strengthening governance will not be accepted.

---

## What VincentOS Is (Contribution Perspective)

VincentOS is:

- An architecture and protocol for governed cognition
- A model-agnostic control plane
- A standards-oriented system-in-formation

VincentOS is **not**:

- A playground for prompt experimentation
- A competition between AI models
- An agent feature marketplace
- A rapid prototyping sandbox

Understanding this distinction is essential before contributing.

## Types of Contributions We Welcome

We welcome contributions in the following areas:

### 1. Specification & Architecture

- Clarifying or tightening architectural definitions
- Identifying ambiguities or contradictions in the spec
- Proposing governance primitives or invariants
- Improving the precision of terminology

### 2. Governance & Safety

- Threat modeling and adversarial analysis
- Failure mode identification
- Governance edge cases
- Arbitration and escalation semantics

### 3. Documentation

- Improving clarity and accessibility of docs
- Diagrams that faithfully reflect the architecture
- Editorial corrections and consistency fixes

### 4. Reference Implementations (When Applicable)

- Minimal, illustrative implementations
- Code that demonstrates governance enforcement
- Test cases that validate invariants

Reference code must remain subordinate to the architecture not the other way around.

## Contributions That Require Prior Discussion

Please open an issue or discussion **before** submitting pull requests for:

- New subsystems or major structural changes
- Changes affecting governance boundaries
- Runtime implementations that could be interpreted as production-ready
- Anything that could impact safety, auditability, or human authority

Early discussion prevents misalignment and wasted effort.

---

## Out of Scope Contributions

The following will generally not be accepted:

- Prompt libraries or prompt-engineering techniques
- Model-specific optimizations
- Claims of increased intelligence or autonomy
- Features that bypass governance controls
- Code that removes or weakens human-in-the-loop requirements

VincentOS explicitly rejects unbounded autonomy.

---

## Decision-Making & Disagreement Resolution

VincentOS is a **governance-first project**, and the same applies to contributions.

- Technical merit is necessary but not sufficient
- Governance impact is always considered
- Safety and reversibility take precedence over novelty

In cases of disagreement:

1. Architectural invariants take priority
2. Governance and safety concerns override performance arguments
3. The project maintainer has final decision authority

Respectful dissent is welcome. Hostile escalation is not.

---

## Code Quality & Style (If Applicable)

If contributing code:

- Keep implementations minimal and explicit
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Document assumptions and limitations
- Avoid hidden state or opaque logic

All code should be readable by someone auditing it for governance and safety.

## Legal & Licensing

By contributing to VincentOS, you agree that:

- Your contributions are licensed under the **Apache License 2.0**
- You have the right to submit the contribution
- You are not knowingly contributing patented material without disclosure

This project does not require a separate Contributor License Agreement (CLA) at this time.

---

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to adhere to the project’s **Code of Conduct**.

Professional, respectful collaboration is mandatory.

---

## Final Note

VincentOS is not optimized for velocity. It is optimized for **trust**.

If that aligns with how you build, think, and collaborate, you are welcome here.
