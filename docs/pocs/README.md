## Proofs of Concept (POCs)

This section contains four independent Proofs of Concept (POCs) that explore how
VincentOS governance principles can be applied to different AI-driven reasoning
scenarios.

These POCs are **illustrative, not executable**. They do not represent a runtime,
agent framework, or production system. Instead, they demonstrate how governance
constraints, accountability rules, and cognitive boundaries alter reasoning flow
when applied above AI models.

### 🎥 POC Overview Video

The following video provides a narrated synthesis of the four VincentOS POCs.
It was generated from the POC documentation using NotebookLM and is intended as
an architectural walkthrough—not a performance demo.
